# AUTO GROCERY
AUTO GROCERY is a project of AUTO_1 Team repository for Demo Day of "MLT2D-Machine Learning with TensorFlow" training in 2022. The training is Professional Academy Digital Talent Scholarship Program organized by The Ministry of Communication and Information Technology of Indonesia and supported by Google. Team AUTO_1 assigned by theme of Automatic checkout, warehouse, or stock inventory system with Grocery Data dataset. 

The dataset is provided by training organizer and avalable here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1N9wt3tRLwxOUFf5FiMKf9078vpd6LpmI.
We create data analytics and three machine learning model: 
1. Sales Prediction, a model to predict peak hour based on sales per minutes (limited data, need more improvement)
2. Recommendation System, a simple Item Based Recommendation using Pairwise Correlation
3. Association Rules, a market basket analysis using Apriori algorithm

AUTO_1 Team consists of three people as follows:
1. Wisnu Anugrah Pratama (DTS ID: 152236035101-482)
2. Wahyono Puji Setianto (DTS ID: 152236035100-856)
3. Muhammad Rezky Pratama (DTS ID: 152236035101-406)
